##datasets_questions
The aggregated Enron email + financial dataset is stored in a dictionary, where each key in the dictionary is a personâ€™s name and the value is a dictionary containing all the features of that person.
The email + finance (E+F) data dictionary is stored as a pickle file, which is a handy way to store and load python objects directly. Use datasets_questions/explore_enron_data.py to load the dataset.

How many data points (people) are in the dataset?
