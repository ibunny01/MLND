    "Welcome to the fourth project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, template code has already been provided for you to aid in your analysis of the *Smartcab* and your implemented learning algorithm. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. There will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and the visualizations provided in the notebook. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide in `agent.py`.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety** and **Reliability** are measured using a letter-grade system as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Grade \t| Safety \t| Reliability \t|\n",
    "|:-----:\t|:------:\t|:-----------:\t|\n",
    "|   A+  \t|  Agent commits no traffic violations,<br/>and always chooses the correct action. | Agent reaches the destination in time<br />for 100% of trips. |\n",
    "|   A   \t|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |\n",
    "|   B   \t| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |\n",
    "|   C   \t|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |\n",
    "|   D   \t| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       \t| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "|   F   \t|  Agent causes at least one major accident,<br />such as driving through a red light with cross-traffic.      \t| Agent fails to reach the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist evaluating these important metrics, you will need to load visualization code that will be used later on in the project. Run the code cell below to import this code which is required for your analysis."

    "Before starting to work on implementing your driving agent, it's necessary to first understand the world (environment) which the *Smartcab* and driving agent work in. One of the major components to building a self-learning agent is understanding the characteristics about the agent, which includes how the agent operates. To begin, simply run the `agent.py` agent code exactly how it is -- no need to make any additions whatsoever. Let the resulting simulation run for some time to see the various working components. Note that in the visual simulation (if enabled), the **white vehicle** is the *Smartcab*."

In this case, a valid action is one of `None`, (do nothing) `'Left'` (turn left), `'Right'` (turn right), or `'Forward'` (go forward). For your first implementation, navigate to the `'choose_action()'` agent function and make the driving agent randomly choose one of these actions. Note that you have access to several class variables that will help you write this functionality, such as `'self.learning'` and `'self.valid_actions'`. Once implemented, run the agent file and simulation briefly to confirm that your driving agent is taking a random action each time step."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *How frequently is the driving agent making bad decisions? How many of those bad decisions cause accidents?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  The agent makes a bad decision with a probability of about 0.4-0.5. But the result of the agent's choice has never been a major accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Given that the agent is driving randomly, does the rate of reliabilty make sense?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  After the learning phase, I received F grade as a result of the trial. (In fact, it is the result of a random action that did not learn because it did not implement the learning algorithm.) I think it is reasonable because there was no policy of action at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *What kind of rewards is the agent receiving for its actions? Do the rewards suggest it has been penalized heavily?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  The reward that is provided in this environment is the reward that occurs depending on whether the agent 's behavior conforms to the traffic regulations. (It seems that there was no accident because elements such as alpha and epsilon were fixed.) Actually, the environment.act () function that computes the reward is calculated by subtracting the penalty that occurs over time from the +1 or +2 reward when moving according to the traffic regulations. However, if you violate the traffic regulations, you can see that it imposes a very bad reward from -5 to -40.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *As the number of trials increases, does the outcome of results change significantly?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  Learning continues but the results do not seem to improve significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In the first figure, the number of Bad Action is decreasing after 13th. However, it is difficult to say that the results of the learning were influential because the Bad Action continued to increase until the 13th.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In terms of the reliability of arriving at the final destination, it is hard to see that it has stayed at 0% from the beginning to the end, which is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Would this Smartcab be considered safe and/or reliable for its passengers? Why or why not?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  This SmartCab is certainly safe. There is a violation of minor traffic laws but no serious violations. But in terms of reaching your destination, you will not be able to hear good stories from your passengers. It is only an unreliable means of transportation that has forgotten the purpose of transportation at present."

    "## Inform the Driving Agent\n",
    "The second step to creating an optimized Q-learning driving agent is defining a set of states that the agent can occupy in the environment. Depending on the input, sensory data, and additional variables available to the driving agent, a set of states can be defined for the agent so that it can eventually *learn* what action it should take when occupying a state. The condition of `'if state then action'` for each state is called a **policy**, and is ultimately what the driving agent is expected to learn. Without defining states, the driving agent would never understand which action is most optimal -- or even what environmental variables and conditions it cares about!"

    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to begin implementing the functionality of Q-Learning itself. The concept of Q-Learning is fairly straightforward: For every state the agent visits, create an entry in the Q-table for all state-action pairs available. Then, when the agent encounters a state and performs an action, update the Q-value associated with that state-action pair based on the reward received and the interative update rule implemented. Of course, additional benefits come from Q-Learning, such that we can have the agent choose the *best* action for each state based on the Q-values of each state-action pair possible. For this project, you will be implementing a *decaying,* $\\epsilon$*-greedy* Q-learning algorithm with *no* discount factor. Follow the implementation instructions under each **TODO** in the agent functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the agent attribute `self.Q` is a dictionary: This is how the Q-table will be formed. Each state will be a key of the `self.Q` dictionary, and each value will then be another dictionary that holds the *action* and *Q-value*. Here is an example:\n",

Additionally, The agent will be tested on what it has learned after $\\epsilon$ has passed a certain threshold (the default threshold is 0.01).

Now that the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented and the driving agent is successfully learning, it's necessary to tune settings and adjust learning paramaters so the driving agent learns both **safety** and **efficiency**. Typically this step will require a lot of trial and error, as some settings will invariably make the learning worse. One thing to keep in mind is the act of learning itself and the time that this takes: In theory, we could allow the agent to learn for an incredibly long amount of time; however, another goal of Q-Learning is to *transition from experimenting with unlearned behavior to acting on learned behavior*. For example, always allowing the agent to perform a random action during training (if $\\epsilon = 1$ and never decays) will certainly make it *learn*, but never let it *act*. When improving on your Q-Learning implementation, consider the impliciations it creates and whether it is logistically sensible to make a particular adjustment."

Here, however, you can concretely define what it is the agent is trying to learn, and that is the U.S. right-of-way traffic laws. Since these laws are known information, you can further define, for each state the *Smartcab* is occupying, the optimal action for the driving agent based on these laws. In that case, we call the set of optimal state-action pairs an **optimal policy**. Hence, unlike some theoretical answers, it is clear whether the agent is acting \"incorrectly\" not only by the reward (penalty) it receives, but also by pure observation. If the agent drives through a red light, we both see it receive a negative reward but also know that it is not the correct behavior. This can be used to your advantage for verifying whether the **policy** your driving agent has learned is the correct one, or if it is a **suboptimal policy**."
