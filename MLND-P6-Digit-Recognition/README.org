** Datasets
- [[http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/][The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset]] : SVHN is a real-world
  image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition
  algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and
  formatting. It can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the
  images are of small cropped digits), but incorporates an order of
  magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes
  from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem
  (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is
  obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

** Library suggested by Udacity
- [[https://keras.io/][Keras.io]]
  Keras is a high-level neural networks library, written in
  Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or
  Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast
  experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least
  possible delay is key to doing good research.
