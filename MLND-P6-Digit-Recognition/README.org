** Library suggested by Udacity
- [[https://keras.io/][Keras.io]]
  Keras is a high-level neural networks library, written in
  Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or
  Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast
  experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least
  possible delay is key to doing good research.
